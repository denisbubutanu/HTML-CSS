This is my Copy of a Bank Statement folder where I will be storing my HTML and CSS code for a (fake) Bank Statement. Although this was a rather simple task whose main purpose was to get me acquainted to VSCode and pushing code to GitHub from it, it also bought together a lot of HTML and CSS concepts I learned over time, as well as teaching me entirely new ones such as svg.
