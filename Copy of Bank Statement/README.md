This is my Copy of a Bank Statement folder where I will be storing my HTML and CSS code for a (fake) Bank Statement. This was a very simple task here only to get me acquainted with VSCode and GitHub, but it did bring together a lot of HTML and CSS concepts I learned over time, as well as teaching me entirely new ones such as svg.
