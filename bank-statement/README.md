## This is my Copy of a Bank Statement folder where I will be storing my HTML and CSS code for a (fake) Bank Statement. 

I reiterate, the bank statement is COMPLETELY FAKE, any names, values, etc have been made up. It merely resembles a Nationwide Bank Statement.

## Why did I decide to do this?

I was looking over a bank statement and I thought to myself: "Could I make this exact layout with HTML and CSS?"
I was unsure of how to handle certain design elements such as the oddly shaped border around the main table, so I thought it would make for a nice challenge. While learning SVGs took some time, I didn't expect the alignment of elements to be so difficult!

## Skills applied and design choices

Through this task, I practiced using VSCode as my main IDE and pushing code from it to my GitHub repositories. It also bought together a lot of HTML and CSS concepts I learned over time as well as teaching me entirely new ones such as SVGs (used for the oddly-shaped border around the table).

The almost exclusive use of px units makes it a completely static page, which was a deliberate decision, as I wanted it to resemble a real bank statement opened in a pdf viewer as much as possible. I now realise that was a very limiting choice. I will eventually make a version where I will use other responsive units such as vh/vw, rem, em, etc. 

## How to run?

Using GitHub Pages, the following link should allow you to see the code in action: https://denisbubutanu.github.io/HTML-CSS-Projects/bank-statement/index.html
