## One of my first HTML and CSS undertakings! 

This project was mostly to get acquainted with images, lists, links and the like. I also added a picture of a lightbulb before each list element in the Life section. I was quite proud of that!

Don't mind the slight over-glamorisation in the takeaways tab. 

## How to run?

Using GitHub Pages, the following link should allow you to see the code in action: https://denisbubutanu.github.io/HTML-CSS-Projects/other-projects/tribute-page/index.html
