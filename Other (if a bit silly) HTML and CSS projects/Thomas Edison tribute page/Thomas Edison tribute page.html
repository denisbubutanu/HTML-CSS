      <p id="tribute-info">Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor and businessman. He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.</p>

        <p>Thomas Edison was nowhere near as naturally intelligent as his co-worker and later rival Nikola Tesla, but he worked hard and became a great man nonetheless. By all accounts he was an average man; and by all accounts the mountain he decided to treck was insurmountable. But it is exactly because he was so average that he had no time to waste looking down and making excuses. With average charisma, only slighlty above average intellect and a tendancy to attract the most rotten luck possible, he would often call himself the unluckiest man in the world. Only later did he admit that he may not have been blessed with great attributes by birth, but he was blessed to be born in a great family that loved him and inspired him to work hard. He was blessed to meet great friends and rivals that elevated him beyond what was possible for an average guy. He was blessed with the passion to pursue what he loved and dedicate every onunce of himself to his craft. Truly, he admitted, he was the luckiest man in the world.</p>
